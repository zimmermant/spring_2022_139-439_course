Because we have \"renamed\" the Pyplot module to be `plt`, all Pyplot commands should start with `plt.`  To use the `plot()` command we need to type `plt.plot()`.  The example below shows how to generate a list of t values from 0 to 14, calculate a list of values for the y-position, and then plot the data.
